This is me getting back to it. Coding. Doing What I love, to the fullest this time round. I got you Sam.

I'm relearning how to use github and git altogether. With a twist this time. I'm using AI. Learning's gonna be so much faster and much more fun.
Can't wait!!

Also this is me refreshing on github so this is just one of my projects I have to test out.

It works to solve for puzzle 67 I think. Just confirm the addresses if you want to.
